## 🤔 What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into:

- **Systems that think like humans**
- **Systems that act like humans**
- **Systems that think rationally**
- **Systems that act rationally**

### Acting Humanly: The Turing Test
- **Alan Turing (1950)**: "Can machines behave intelligently?"
- Requirements for a machine to pass the Turing Test:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Knowledge Representation
  - Automated Reasoning
  - Machine Learning
- Challenges:
  - Incorporating senses (vision, hearing, etc.)
  - Movement and maneuverability
  - Common sense reasoning

### Thinking Humanly: Cognitive Science
- Understand and simulate human thought processes.
- Based on scientific theories of brain activities.
- Involves levels of abstraction such as "knowledge" or "neural circuits".
- Neural networks as models.

### Thinking Rationally: Laws of Thought
- Rooted in philosophy and logic (Aristotle).
- Focus on **correct** reasoning and argument structures.
- Problems:
  - Intelligent behavior isn't always logical.
  - Decision-making involves prioritizing thoughts.
  - Premises aren't always certain.

### Acting Rationally: Rational Agents
- **Agent**: An entity that perceives and acts.
- Characteristics of rational agents:
  - Operate autonomously
  - Perceive and adapt to the environment
  - Persist over time
  - Pursue goals and make decisions under uncertainty

## 🕰️ A Brief History of AI

### AI Prehistory
- **Philosophy**: Logic, reasoning methods.
- **Mathematics**: Formal proofs, computation theory.
- **Psychology**: Perception, learning models.
- **Economics**: Rational decision theory.
- **Linguistics**: Language structure.
- **Neuroscience**: Biological basis for thought.

### Potted History of AI
- **1943**: McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model of the brain.
- **1950**: Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".
- **1952-69**: Early AI programs (Samuel’s Checkers, Logic Theorist).
- **1956**: Dartmouth Conference — "Artificial Intelligence" term coined.
- **1966-74**: AI confronts computational complexity.
- **1980s**: Expert systems boom.
- **1988-93**: Expert systems bust — "AI Winter".
- **1995-present**:
  - Return of neural networks.
  - Rise of probabilistic methods.
  - "Nouvelle AI" (e.g., Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Life).
  - Multi-agent systems.

## 🎯 State of the Art in AI

Capabilities AI can currently achieve:
- Play a decent game of table tennis
- Drive safely along a curving mountain road
- Buy a week's worth of groceries online
- Play bridge reasonably well
- Discover and prove new mathematical theorems
- Design and execute research in molecular biology
- Write funny stories intentionally
- Give competent legal advice in specialized fields
- Translate spoken English to Swedish in real time
- Hold a conversation for an hour
- Perform complex surgical operations
- (Almost) unload a dishwasher perfectly without parental scolding!

## 🚨 Risks and Benefits of AI

### Benefits
- Reduce repetitive tasks.
- Boost productivity.
- Accelerate scientific research.
- Solve large-scale societal problems (e.g., disease, climate change).

### Risks
- Lethal autonomous weapons.
- Mass surveillance and manipulation.
- Algorithmic bias in decision-making.
- Impact on employment and job displacement.
- Vulnerabilities in cybersecurity.
- Safety in critical applications (e.g., healthcare, transport).

> **Warning**: Development of artificial superintelligence could create a "Gorilla problem" scenario, where AI surpasses human control.

# 🌟 Key Takeaway
Artificial Intelligence is a multidisciplinary field aiming to create machines that can think and act either like humans or rationally based on the context. Understanding both the immense potential and significant risks is essential as AI continues to evolve.
