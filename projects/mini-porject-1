# COMP 472 - Artificial Intelligence (Summer 2025)

## 📝 Mini Project 1

**Due Date:** _As indicated on Moodle_  
**Group Requirement:**  
- Minimum: 2 members  
- Maximum: 3 members  
- ⚠️ **50% penalty** if working alone or in a group with more than 3 members.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To get familiar with Python and some of its AI libraries through a hands-on project.

---

## 📌 Project Description

In this project, you will develop a **machine learning app** that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using the **MNIST** dataset.

### Required Libraries

You must use at least the following two libraries:

1. [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/) – For data exploration and manipulation.
2. [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) – To build a simple baseline model using **Logistic Regression**.

Optionally, you may use:

- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) – To visualize image samples.

---

## 🧠 Dataset

Python includes a dataset of approximately **1,800 grayscale images** of handwritten digits. You will:

- Use `NumPy` to store and normalize the data.
- Visualize sample digits using `matplotlib` (optional but helpful).

---

## 🛠️ Model Training

Split the dataset as follows:

- **Training Set:** 80%  
- **Testing Set:** 20%

Use `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.  
Learn the basics of **Logistic Regression** to understand its usage (no need to dive deep into theory).

---

## 📊 Evaluation

You must evaluate the performance of your model using:

- `classification_report`
- `confusion_matrix`

Print these in your program to show model performance.

---

## 📚 Documentation & 🎤 Presentation

- Document your code and describe its functionality clearly.
- All team members must be familiar with the full codebase.
- You will present a **live demo** to your TA.
- Time slots for the demo will be posted on Moodle.
- **Every group member must be present** and ready to answer questions.

---

## 📦 Submission Format

Submit a `.zip` archive of your project on Moodle.

### File Naming Convention:
```bash
<Student1FirstName Student1LastName> <Student1ID> -
<Student2FirstName Student2LastName> <Student2ID> -
<Student3FirstName Student3LastName> <Student3ID>.zip
```
---
> The project **must be coded in Python**.
