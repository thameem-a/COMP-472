Step 1.) Import ~1800 images of hand-written digits, along with the actual values (MNIST dataset).
Step 2.) Verification and normalization procedure (flattens matrix into vector and verifies dataset to some extent)
Step 3.) Split data into training and testing (80% for training, 20% for testing--randomly shuffled)
Step 4.) Train the classifier without a "random start state"
Step 5.) Predict labels of the digits using the training data
Step 6.) Evaluate performance using confusion matrix and classification report
Step 7.) Visualize using matplotlib
